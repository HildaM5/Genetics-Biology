        <h1>Gene Therapy</h1>
        <p class="text">Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. In the future, this technique may allow doctors to treat a disorder by inserting a gene into a patient’s cells instead of using drugs or surgery. Researchers are testing several approaches to gene therapy, including; replacing a mutated gene that causes disease with a healthy copy of the gene, inactivating, or “knocking out,” a mutated gene that is functioning improperly and introducing a new gene into the body to help fight a disease. Researchers have been working for decades to bring gene therapy to the clinic, yet very few patients have received any effective gene-therapy treatments. But that doesn't mean gene therapy is an impossible dream. The first human to receive gene therapy treatment was a 4 year old girl with severe immune-deficiency disease. This disease is caused by a faulty gene that fails to produce a vital enzyme. In the therapy procedure, they extracted some of the girl's white blood cells. Then, they exposed them to a genetically engineered virus that had lost its virulence but still carried normal versions of the gene that was not functioning correctly in the girl. The virus invaded the white blood cells, and then these cells were transfused back into the girl. Once back inside the girl's bloodstream, the cells began producing the proper enzyme. Although the girl still needs follow-up treatments, she now leads a relatively normal life following the gene therapy. This is one of the success stories of gene therapy.</p>
